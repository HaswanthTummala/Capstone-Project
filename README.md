This project, Natural Language Processing to Motivate Expressive Language Development, is an Android-based application designed to assist children with Autism Spectrum 
Disorder (ASD) in improving their expressive language skills. The application integrates advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech recognition technologies
to convert spoken words into digital feedback, including visual, auditory, and tactile responses.

Key Features:
1. Speech-to-Text Conversion: The app accurately recognizes and transcribes spoken language.
2. Visual Feedback: Displays images or colored visual elements based on recognized speech.
3. Auditory and Tactile Outputs: Offers sound and haptic feedback to reinforce communication.
4. User History Tracking: Keeps track of user interaction history for personalized development.
5. Gesture Recognition: Allows users to interact with objects via gestures, enhancing engagement.
6. Customization: Includes settings for tailoring feedback mechanisms and language preferences.
7. Help and Support: Provides comprehensive support and documentation for users.
   
Purpose:

The main objective of this project is to create a tool that motivates and encourages children with ASD to develop natural language
 expression through interaction with technology. By providing instantaneous, multimodal feedback, this app aims to bridge the gap between visual aids
and verbal communication, fostering confidence and independence in users.
